# Public Health Scotland Interactive Dashboard

This dashboard was created as a group during the CodeClan Professional Data Analysis course using R Shiny.  
[Data was taken from Public Health Scotland](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/annual-cancer-incidence).

**Collaborators:** Justyna Rosiak, Emma Menzies, Louise Laurenson, Tom D

# Purpose

The key questions explored in this dashboard are:

1. To what extent are the ‘winter crises’ reported by the media real?
2. How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected provision of acute care in Scotland?

These questions were explored from three different angles: temporal, geographic, demographic

# Structure and Dashboard

The final version of the dashboard is within the `test` folder of the repo.

The dashboard has three tabs: Admissions, Length of Stay, and Beds.   
These tabs contain interactive data visualisations where demographics, health boards, and type of admissions can be explored by the user.
